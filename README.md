### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics discussed in the labs did help prepare me to complete the assignment as we covered all the features that I implemented. However, I would say that some aspects of the assignment differed from what we learned in lab, which required me to make certain adjustments and adapt my approach. Nonetheless, the foundational knowledge gained from the lab sessions proved valuable in tackling the weekly assignment.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would have made several improvements to my project. Firstly, I would have focused on enhancing the responsive web design features to ensure that the website looks good on both Android and iOS devices. Additionally, I would have added a description of the website under the default page to provide users with a better idea of what the website is about.

Furthermore, I would have included a sidebar featuring the liked and favorited movies by creating an array and appending them when clicked. This would have allowed users to access their preferred movies more easily.

Moreover, I would have added more details to make the modal more versatile and useful for users. For instance, including movie trailers or reviews in the modal would have enriched the user experience.

Another idea I had was to keep the Flixter API call on the screen throughout the website visit to avoid having to refresh the page every time a new movie is searched. Lastly, I would have considered breaking down my components even further to make the code more organized and maintainable.


* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Overall, I am pleased with how my project demo went. The website performed well and received positive feedback from my peers, particularly regarding the design aspect. Although there were some differences in response between Google Chrome and Safari, the performance was generally similar.

One idea that emerged during discussions with my peers after the demo was to incorporate a feature where the modal updates with random movies if the user remains inactive for a certain period. This could potentially keep users engaged and add an element of surprise to the website.

Despite some components taking longer than anticipated to develop and the CSS requiring significant effort, the end result has left me very satisfied. I appreciate the valuable feedback from my peers and am content with the outcome of my project demo.
